# Voronoi-Halfspace

# Overview

This project provides a mathematical and computational approach to finding the Voronoi half-space that separates two points in Euclidean space. The half-space represents the set of all points that are closer to one point than the another and is defined in the form:

        { x âˆˆ R^n | c^Tx <= d }
        
where c is the normal vector and d is the threshold value.
